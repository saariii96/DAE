**1. Introduction**

In recent years, the monitoring and analysis of adverse drug reactions
has become increasingly important in pharmacovigilance and clinical
research. The accurate identification of associations between drugs and
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is essential to ensure patient safety and
support evidence-based medical decision-making (Harpaz et al., 2012).

One of the main challenges in this area is the inconsistent
representation of drug names - which often appear under multiple brand
names, generic forms or synonyms - making data collection and analysis
difficult (Liu et al., 2015; Tiktinsky et al., 2023). Conventional
string matching approaches are often insufficient to reliably resolve
such variations and can lead to incomplete datasets and overlooked
signals.

With the advent of large language models (LLMs), natural language
processing (NLP) techniques have shown great potential for resolving
semantic ambiguities in biomedical texts. These models, such as OpenAI's
GPT, have shown top performance in tasks such as synonym generation,
text classification, and linking biomedical concepts (Brown et al.,
2020; Sung et al., 2023).

In this project, an LLM (GPT-3.5-Turbo) was used to generate extended
synonym lists for a number of the most commonly reported drugs. These
synonyms were then used to improve the identification of drugs in the
OpenFDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), from which drug-related
adverse event data was extracted. By combining these sources, a more
complete and representative adverse drug reaction dataset was created.

This dataset was converted into a binary matrix format, with rows
representing drug synonyms and columns representing specific adverse
drug reactions. Both exploratory and predictive analyses were performed
on this basis. Exploratory steps included the identification of common
adverse drug reactions, patterns of co-occurrence of drugs and
reactions, and the visualization of these relationships using bar
charts, heat maps, bubble plots and clustering.

In addition, a machine learning component was added to the pipeline,
where random forest classifiers were trained to predict the presence of
individual side effects based on the drug profile. The feature
importance scores derived from these models were used to determine which
drugs contribute most to the prediction of specific side effects.

To make these findings accessible and actionable, a Shiny web
application was developed that allows users to interactively query the
drug-side effect matrix, examine patterns, and filter results by
individual drug or drug group.

This project had two objectives: (1) to develop a technically innovative
system that utilizes state-of-the-art NLP and public health data for
improved adverse drug reaction detection, and (2) to create a practical
tool that bridges the gap between academic research and real-world
healthcare applications. As part of a master's degree program in health
sciences, this work reflects both scientific rigor and clinical
relevance.

This report describes the entire workflow of the project - from data
collection and enrichment to modeling, visualization, and deployment -
and concludes with a discussion of potential future extensions and
limitations.

**2. Data and Methods**

### 2. Data and methods

This study is based on publicly available data on adverse events from
the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration's OpenFDA API]
(<https://open.fda.gov/apis/drug/event/>) (FDA, n.d.). The dataset
contains structured information about adverse drug reactions (ADRs),
medications (both brand and generic names), patient demographics, and
the date of the event. These records are voluntarily submitted by
healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical companies, and consumers as
part of post-marketing surveillance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2.1 Data collection and preprocessing

Reports of adverse events were retrieved via the “drug/event” endpoint
of the OpenFDA API. To focus on the most relevant drugs, the 100 most
frequently reported drugs were identified via an API query and used as a
starting point. These included commonly used drugs such as ibuprofen,
Humira, and metformin.

Since drug names often appear under different brand names, generic
names, or regional spellings, each entry was expanded using the Large
Language Model (LLM). Specifically, OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model was
programmatically queried to generate alternative names and common
synonyms for each drug. This ensured that potential mentions under
different aliases were not overlooked during data collection.

Each drug was then enriched with side effect data from OpenFDA. The
reported side effects were extracted from the `reactionmeddrapt` field
and transferred to a structured format. The processing pipeline included
the following: - LLM-based synonym expansion - Automated and batch
OpenFDA API queries - Text standardization and cleaning (e.g., splitting
entries separated by semicolons)

The final dataset was formatted as a binary matrix, with rows
representing drug synonyms and columns representing potential side
effects. A value of “1” means that a specific side effect has been
reported for the corresponding drug synonym.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2.2 Exploratory data analysis

Descriptive analysis techniques were used to uncover patterns of
frequency and correlations. The most important visual tools included: -
Bar charts showing the most frequently reported side effects and drugs -
Heat maps (top 30 × top 30) to visualize the co-occurrence of drugs and
side effects - Bubble plots to highlight the intensity and overlap of
drug-effect relationships - Dendrograms to group drugs based on their
side effect profiles

These visualizations provided insight into which drugs tend to cause
similar reactions and which side effects occur with multiple substances.
All data processing and visualization was implemented in R using
packages such as tidyverse, ggplot2, plotly, and pheatmap.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2.3 Classification Model

To explore associations between medications and side effects, a series
of supervised classification models was developed using the random
forest algorithm.

In the first analysis, a separate random forest classifier was trained
for each individual side effect. The input data consisted of a binary
matrix, where rows represented drug synonyms and columns represented the
presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of specific side effects.

Rather than training a single multi-label model, a binary relevance
approach was used—meaning one binary classifier was trained per target
variable (i.e., side effect). This method treats each classification
task independently and allows detailed performance evaluation per side
effect.

Each model was evaluated based on: - Prediction accuracy on a stratified
70/30 train-test split - Feature importance scores (MeanDecreaseGini),
indicating which drug synonyms were most predictive

This analysis revealed: - Which side effects were most predictable from
drug profiles - Which medications were most strongly associated with
individual adverse reactions

In a secondary analysis, the same dataset was transposed so that side
effects became predictors and the target remained a single side effect.
The aim was to evaluate whether the occurrence of one side effect could
help predict the presence of another.

This co-prediction approach uncovered potential dependencies and symptom
clusters. Each model output revealed: - The predictive accuracy of a
side effect based on others - Which side effects were most informative
for predicting a specific outcome

These insights may help generate hypotheses for further clinical
investigation and support the detection of syndromic patterns in adverse
event reporting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2.4 Interactive Shiny application

To make the results accessible and usable for a wider audience, an
interactive Shiny web application was developed. Key features include: -
Search for drugs or synonyms - Display of all known synonyms per drug -
Display of the three most common side effects per drug - Interactive
heat maps and bubble charts using `plotly` - Export of analysis results
as CSV

The application serves as a practical interface for exploring the
underlying data and analysis results. The entire source code, data
files, and analysis scripts are managed in a structured [GitHub
repository] (<https://github.com/saariii96/DAE>).

### 3. Results

This chapter presents the results of descriptive and predictive analyses
performed on a drug–side effect dataset obtained via the OpenFDA API.
The data was preprocessed and extended using synonym generation through
an LLM (GPT-3.5), and structured into a binary matrix where each row
represents a drug synonym and each column a reported side effect.

### 4. Discussion

This study explored the integration of real-world drug surveillance data with language model-based synonym generation to improve the analysis of associations between drugs and adverse events. The main objective was to evaluate how combining structured event data from the OpenFDA API with LLM-based drug identification can support both descriptive and predictive assessments of adverse drug reactions (ADRs).

The frequency-based analyses in Section 3.1 confirmed known trends in pharmacovigilance data. Non-specific and frequently reported symptoms such as headache, nausea, and fatigue were among the most common, reflecting both the actual prevalence and reporting bias in voluntary reports. Medicines with a broad systemic effect—such as biologics and immunosuppressants—were associated with a high number of different adverse reactions, which is consistent with their pharmacological profile and their use in complex patient groups.

Visualizations such as the heat map and bubble plot illustrated clear patterns of co-occurrence of medicines and certain adverse reactions. Hierarchical clustering revealed that drugs with similar mechanisms of action or therapeutic areas tended to be grouped together based on their adverse reaction profiles. These results suggest that adverse reaction data can be used not only for post-marketing surveillance, but also to identify similarities between drugs in terms of their tolerability and risk profile.

The classification results in Section 3.2 showed that certain side effects—such as panic attacks, high blood pressure, and hyperlipidemia—could be predicted with relatively high accuracy based solely on the drugs entered. This suggests that the occurrence of these side effects is closely related to specific drugs or drug classes. Random forest models performed well in this binary classification, and the extracted feature importance scores enabled an interpretable ranking of the drug predictors.

The second classification task, joint prediction of side effects (Section 3.3), extended this approach by using other side effects as input variables. This approach showed that multiple side effects often occur together in a predictable manner. For example, fluid retention and hyperlipidemia were among the most important predictors of high blood pressure. This could be useful for clinical decisions or warning systems where the presence of one symptom increases the likelihood of another.

An interesting aspect of this project was the use of a large language model (GPT-3.5) to generate synonym lists for drugs. This addresses a common limitation in real-world data analysis: the inconsistent reporting of drug names across different sources, including brand names, generics, and abbreviations. By generating expanded synonym lists for each drug, more relevant data could be captured via the OpenFDA API, which in turn improved the completeness and quality of the adverse reaction matrix.

In summary, the combination of LLM-based synonym expansion and structured pharmacovigilance data provided deeper insights into the drug safety landscape. The results are promising for scalable, semi-automated systems to support pharmacovigilance, research, and potentially personalized medicine. The approach could be extended to larger drug sets and multilingual data in future applications.
